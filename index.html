of the consortium, and bowing down to protect its interests, boycotting the represenators of communist, as a beleiver in constitutional 
monarchy, put forward my work to general public;

Whereas, this work is to be dedicated in entirety to Aryan Ghani, an ally of the interests of Broke Consortium, and the old-age French
Mathematician, Sophie Germain;
