I <i>Aitzaz Imtiaz</i>, a firm follower of Agnosticism, and the "Member of the Broke Consortium of Mathematical Research", the affiliate 
of "Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium", puts forward my work to general public, adhering the norms 
of the consortium, and bowing down to protect its interests, boycotting the represenators of communist aggressors, as a beleiver in 
constitutional monarchy, put forward my work to general public;
<br>
Whereas, this work is to be dedicated in entirety to Aryan Ghani, an ally of the interests of Broke Consortium, and the old-age French
Mathematician, Sophie Germain;
